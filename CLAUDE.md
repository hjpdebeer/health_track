# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a health tracking application repository. The codebase is currently empty and ready for initial development.

## Getting Started

This repository appears to be a fresh project setup. When developing the health tracking application, consider:

- Choosing an appropriate technology stack (web app, mobile app, or both)
- Setting up proper project structure with package management
- Implementing core health tracking features like vital signs monitoring, activity tracking, or health metrics logging
- Adding appropriate build and test commands once the project structure is established

## Development Commands

Commands will be added here once the project structure and tooling are established.

## Architecture Notes

Architecture documentation will be added as the project develops and core components are implemented.
